# Hi, I'm Colin! 👋

Welcome to my digital playground. This portfolio is a collection of my work, thoughts, and experiments in building interactive web experiences. It's designed not just to show *what* I can do, but *how* I think about user interface and design.

### What's Inside?
Instead of a static list of projects, I wanted to build something that feels alive.
- **Interactive Physics**: Toss the skill icons around in the "Skills" section—it's surprisingly therapeutic!
- **Dynamic Projects**: A curated value-first look at what I've been building.
- **Smooth Experience**: Optimized for performance and fluidity.

### Built With
Crafted with **React** and **Vite**, focusing on performance and custom interactions.
